A relatively simple C programm, illustrating the classic "word game".
One player enters a word, then another player tries to guess that word
trying individual letters, revealing a part of the word upon a correct guess.
If they ran out of attemps they lose, but if they guess all the letters in the word they win!

Just compile and run where you would run a C programm, the game will appear on the console
